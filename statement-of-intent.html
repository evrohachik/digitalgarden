      &lt;td&gt;[[Hypha]]â€™s practice is situated across many topics that are present in the theme of &lt;em&gt;Adaptive Reuse &amp;amp; Creative Misuse&lt;/em&gt;. Drawing from our collective experiences, histories, and methodologies, our goal for the micro-residency to investigate how notions of digital [[infrastructure]] can be reused, reinterpreted, and reconfigured, to realize a kind of public space. Our approach to this theme will be composed of a few, very preliminary, subjects that will ground the residency: the situated histories of digital infrastructure, the implications of protocols for [[publishing]] ([[Hypertext]], [[RSS]], [[Peer-to-peer]]) in defining public spaces, and the possibilities of cooperative approaches to maintenance and repair. Our intent is to make the process of this investigation [[public]] through online tools mapping our thinking about the theme (Open channels in Are.na as one example) and cultivating a [[Digital Public Garden]] as part of Hyphaâ€™s contributions to the initiative (a [[RSS&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;resyndicatable]] adaptive online notebook). The outputs from the [[bentway&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;micro-residency]] will be a written contribution to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.are.na/from-later/field-guide-to-the-digital-real&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Field Guide to the Digital Real&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a micro-website containing the synthesis of our investigations and our evolving practice. The outputs will be textual and visual, and draw from our collaborative practices as a cooperative. They will explore ways to represent relationships with existing and emergent technologies within our communities. Through our micro-residency we will capture a poetic interpretation of the theme and provide prompts for institutions in the city on how they could reconfigure technology to create radically creative platforms.&lt;/td&gt;
