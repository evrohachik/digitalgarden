The outputs will be textual and visual, and draw from our collaborative practices as a cooperative. They will explore ways to represent relationships with existing and emergent technologies within our communities. Through our micro-residency we will capture a poetic interpretation of the theme and provide prompts for institutions in the city on how they could reconfigure technology to create radically creative platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

        <p>Hyphaâ€™s practice is situated across many topics that are present in the theme of <em>Adaptive Reuse &amp; Creative Misuse</em>.
