**What is it that you hope to explore during your residency?**

We are exploring the protocols, languages, and material of the internet as a place for experimentation and practice. The exploration is based on composing multiple histories of the internet into a collective resyndicatable [[digital public garden|digital garden]] to weave the examples, narratives, and ideas together as a contribution to the [[Field Guide to the Digital Real]]. We are interested in how this garden can serve as a site for [micro] world-making as we repurpose the existing internet through our practice.

**Can you provide a great, existing example (that we can share with audiences who may be unfamiliar with this line of thinking/work)?**
