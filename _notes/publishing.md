Publishing as a way of making a thing public, making it known and available. A sense of (re) distribution of the work or thing and knowledge associated with it.

- Purely definitional:

> Publishing is the activity of making information, literature, music, software and other content available to the public for sale or for free. Traditionally, the term refers to the distribution of printed works, such as books, newspapers, and magazines.

and from Oxford English Dictionary:

> publishing, n.
> 1. The action of making something publicly known; official or public notification; promulgation, public announcement; = publication n. 1.
> 2. The action or business of preparing and issuing books, newspapers, etc., for public sale or distribution; an instance of this; = publication n. 2. Cf. publish v. 3a.

- Experiment around digital publishing from fellow [[Hypha|Hypha Co-op]] member-workers:

> We are building the Distributed Press â€” a beginner friendly, open-source publishing tool for the distributed web. Aiming to empower authors, Distributed Press utilizes the distributed web to amplify free expression worldwide, while exposing sources of misinformation.
> We all have a sense of the wide-ranging and complex issues facing publishing today: political censorship, disinformation, walled gardens, and the decline of independent media. Yet the solutions to these challenges remain unclear. Working with authors, audiences, and distributed web communities, we hope to co-develop new tools, in order to make publishing fair, democratic, and dignified for all.

- Something about recent ecosystem of publishing (James Pogue. January 2020. "They Made a Movie Out of It"):

> Almost all notable book-length nonfiction written in this country emerges as an expansion of work that was first published by a magazine, soâ€”whether they admit it or notâ€”magazines are the incubators for the nonfiction writers who describe our world. But these outlets generally make not the barest pretense of trying to pay writers enough to build a life. Instead, editors at prestige outlets increasingly view writing as germinal IP. We have a perfectly good word for the kind of writing and reporting this all encourages: trash.
