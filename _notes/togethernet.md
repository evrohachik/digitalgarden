> Togethernet is a collaborative archiving software in the form of a desktop web app that allows both [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P), traceless messaging as well as archived communications.

> Designed around the ethos of data transparency and consent, the goal of the software is to transform digital rights practices such as the [right to be forgotten](https://gdpr.eu/right-to-be-forgotten/) into an embodied practice through the reimagination of software architecture and user experience.

> The software contains two types of communication channels: the Ephemeral Channel and the Archival Channel.

> The Ephemeral Channel uses the WebRTC peer-to-peer protocol, which means conversations do not go through a centralized server (bye google facebook AWS 👋🏼) and are permenantly erased once the browser closes.

> The Archival Channel publishes meeting notes to a centeralized database that your organization may self-host or host on a third party’s server.
