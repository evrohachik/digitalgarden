> Project Xanadu was the first hypertext project, founded in 1960 by Ted Nelson. Administrators of Project Xanadu have declared it an improvement over the [[World Wide Web]], with the mission statement: "Today's popular software simulates paper. The World Wide Web (another imitation of paper) trivialises our original [[hypertext]] model with one-way ever-breaking links and no management of version or contents."

## THE XANADUÂ® PARALLEL UNIVERSE
### Visibly Connected Pages and Documents for a New Kind of Writing

> Conventional electronic documents were designed in the 1970s by well-funded conventional thinkers at Xerox PARC, who asked, "How can we imitate paper?" The result is today's electronic document-- Microsoft Word format and the printout format PDF.  They imitate paper and emphasize appearance and fonts.
>
> But much earlier, in 1960, the Xanadu project started with a completely different idea: since interactive screens are coming (who else knew?), we asked a different question: How can we IMPROVE on paper?
>
> We foresaw a new screen literature of parallel, interconnected documents.
