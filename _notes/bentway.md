The Bentway re-imagines how we build, experience, activate, and value [[public space|public]] space together. With [[From Later]], they are hosting an initiative from March 1 to May 31 called [_Digital and/as Public Space_](https://www.thebentway.ca/event/digital-and-as-public-space/) (see From Later's [Public Notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eXk14blXZSm7EQrksFgcoZ8Rf17rmu7zrBEUyczGG5M/edit#)) which this site is a part of as a micro-residency.
