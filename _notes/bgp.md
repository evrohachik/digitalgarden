Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway [[protocol]] designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. BGP is classified as a path-vector routing protocol, and it makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator.

## BGP: The Internetâ€™s Fragile Beast
### Mike Dank, Radical Networks 2019

BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) manages how all of our packets are routed across the Internet. It is one of the most powerful and important protocols currently deployed on the 'net, but it is also incredibly fragile. Devised as a quick fix 30 years ago (without concern for security), BGP is constantly blamed in the news as Internet outages occur worldwide due to misconfigurations by multinational telecommunications conglomerates or hijackings by government actors.

This talk will demystify the misunderstood protocol that is BGP, and explain how entities exchange giant flows of data across the Internet, highlight past misuses, and consider what we may be able to expect in the future.

## Protocol Tactics

The philosophers have only interpreted the internet, the point is to change it.

IP, BGP, DNS, HTTP, and many more protocols set the boundaries of what we do on the internet. Their specifications and implementations have enabled many great advances, but some of these advances have revealed structures and mechanisms that are objectively counter to their users' needs and wants.

Our communities are radical in many ways, and some of our shared principles are accessibility, ubiquity, sustainability, resilience, and impact.

We'll look at effective tactics used by protocols, old and new, to achieve these principles.

## BGP and the Rule of Custom: How the internet self-governs without international law

When bad actors can simply move servers from country to country, why does the internet remain reasonably civil ? How does one get on, or get kicked off, of the internet ? Why do fraud and child abuse websites regularly get shut down but thepiratebay remains living ? I will explain BGP, the protocol that knits the internet together, also covering the world of last resort hosting, bulletproof hosting and high profile cases of servers that were taken offline and servers which could not be taken offline despite significant effort.
