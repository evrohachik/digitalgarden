We cultivate collective growth and meaningful livelihoods through learning and building technologies together.

We are a team of technologists, designers, and community organizers who value working with mission-oriented organizations.

## Our values

### Together, we have years of experience building open source technologies and sustainable communities.

Our core values reflect our understanding of what it means to cultivate respectful, resilient, and democratic technology ecologies.

## Build change that lasts
Disruptive growth has its costs. We believe that the culture of ‚Äúmove fast and break things‚Äù is untenable. Instead, we seek change that strengthens our communities and nurtures our planet. We work thoughtfully and with care toward the futures we imagine.

## Embody co-operative values
We serve our clients, members, neighbours, and the co-operative movement the world over. Hypha embodies the co-operative values of self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, and solidarity.

## Provide safe harbour
We acknowledge the sacred land we work on is the territory of many nations and was the subject of the Dish with One Spoon Wampum Belt Covenant, an agreement to peaceably share and care for the resources around the Great Lakes. Today it is still home to many First Nations, Inuit, and M√©tis peoples from across Turtle Island. We also recognize the ongoing history of oppression and marginalization in our society and workplaces. Hypha strives to be a safe harbour to all, regardless of race, class, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, religion, or technical skill.
