> The aim of the [[post digital print|Post-Digital Publishing]] Archive (Pâ€”DPA) is to systematically collect, organize and keep trace of experiences in the fields of art and design that explore the relationships between [[publishing]] and digital technology. The archive acts as a space in which the collected projects are confronted and juxtaposed in order to highlight relevant paths, mutual themes, common perspectives, interrelations, but also oppositions and idiosyncrasies.
